# BS and MS Problem sets
Here are some of problem sets that I worked on in some of my courses on electromagnetism, quantum mechanics, and mathematical methods. I especially enjoy solving problems not found in textbooks because it always encouraged collaboration between me and my peers. I have learned from my adviser, Dr Ian Vega, that you do not have to be the fastest one to solve a problem. Sometimes, what it takes to be successful is _persistence_.

_Math and physics courses taken when I was an MS student:_
* Physics 211: **Mathematical Methods of Physics I** (_Distribution theory, Green functions_)
* Physics 221: **Classical Dynamics I**
* Physics 231/232: **Classical Electrodynamics I and II**
* Physics 241/242: **Quantum Mechanics I and II**
* Physics 251: **Statistical Mechanics I**
* Math 235: **Mathematics of Population Biology**
